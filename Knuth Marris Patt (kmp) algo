Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.
Examples:
1) Input:
  txt[] =  "THIS IS A TEST TEXT"
  pat[] = "TEST"
Output:
   Pattern found at index 10
2) Input:
  txt[] =  "AABAACAADAABAAABAA"
  pat[] = "AABA"
Output:
   Pattern found at index 0
   Pattern found at index 9
   Pattern found at index 13
Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results.
We have discussed Naive pattern searching algorithm in the previous post. The worst case complexity of Naive algorithm is O(m(n-m+1)). Time complexity of KMP algorithm is O(n) in worst case.
KMP (Knuth Morris Pratt) Pattern Searching
The Naive pattern searching algorithm doesn’t work well in cases where we see many matching characters followed by a mismatching character. Following are some examples.
   txt[] = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB"
   pat[] = "AAAAB"

   txt[] = "ABABABCABABABCABABABC"
   pat[] =  "ABABAC" (not a worst case, but a bad case for Naive)
The KMP matching algorithm uses degenerating property (pattern having same sub-patterns appearing more than once in the pattern) of the pattern and improves the worst case complexity to O(n). The basic idea behind KMP’s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), we already know some of the characters in the text (since they matched the pattern characters prior to the mismatch). We take advantage of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match.
KMP algorithm does some preprocessing over the pattern pat[] and constructs an auxiliary array lps[] of size m (same as size of pattern). For each sub-pattern pat[0…i] where i = 0 to m-1, it calculates the length of maximum matching proper prefix which is also a suffix of the sub-pattern pat[0..i] and stores the value in lps[i].
   lps[i] = the longest proper prefix of pat[0..i]
              which is also a suffix of pat[0..i]. 
Examples:
For the pattern “AABAACAABAA”, lps[] is [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
For the pattern “ABCDE”, lps[] is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
For the pattern “AAAAA”, lps[] is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
For the pattern “AAABAAA”, lps[] is [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]
For the pattern “AAACAAAAAC”, lps[] is [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Searching Algorithm:
Unlike the Naive algo where we slide the pattern by one, we use a value from lps[] to decide the next sliding position. Let us see how we do that. When we compare pat[j] with txt[i] and see a mismatch, we know that characters pat[0..j-1] match with txt[i-j+1...i-1], and we also know that lps[j-1] characters of pat[0...j-1] are both proper prefix and suffix which means we do not need to match these lps[j-1] characters with txt[i-j...i-1] because we know that these characters will anyway match. See KMPSearch() in the below code for details.
Preprocessing Algorithm:
In the preprocessing part, we calculate values in lps[]. To do that, we keep track of the length of the longest prefix suffix value (we use len variable for this purpose) for the previous index. We initialize lps[0] and len as 0. If pat[len] and pat[i] match, we increment len by 1 and assign the incremented value to lps[i]. If pat[i] and pat[len] do not match and len is not 0, we update len to lps[len-1]. See computeLPSArray () in the below code for details.

void KMPSearch(char *pat, char *txt)

    int M = strlen(pat);
    int N = strlen(txt);
 
    // create lps[] that will hold the longest prefix suffix values for pattern
    int *lps = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*M);
    int j  = 0;  // index for pat[]
 
    // Preprocess the pattern (calculate lps[] array)
    computeLPSArray(pat, M, lps);
 
    int i = 0;  // index for txt[]
    while(i < N)
    {
      if(pat[j] == txt[i])
      {
        j++;
        i++;
      }
 
      if (j == M)
      {
        printf("Found pattern at index %d \n", i-j);
        j = lps[j-1];
      }
 
      // mismatch after j matches
      else if(pat[j] != txt[i])
      {
        // Do not match lps[0..lps[j-1]] characters,
        // they will match anyway
        if(j != 0)
         j = lps[j-1];
        else
         i = i+1;
      }
    }
    free(lps); // to avoid memory leak

         {
           // This is tricky. Consider the example AAACAAAA and i = 7.
           len = lps[len-1];
 
           // Also, note that we do not increment i here
         }
